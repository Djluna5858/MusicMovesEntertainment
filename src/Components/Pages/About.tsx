Music Moves Entertainment was founded by Roger Luna, better known as DJ Luna, with the goal of bringing a positive atmosphere that only a good DJ can infuse into a crowd. </p>
<p className="secondPart">Luna had a deep connection with music in his early years which followed him into his young adult life. This later blossomed into a career as a successful entertainer and music creator. Starting as a drummer for a small band, his eagerness led him to pick up on a multitude of different instruments. He learned how to play bass guitar and percussion, his sound being heavily inspired by his Latino roots as well as popular culture. </p><p className="secondPart">Music Moves aspires to create opportunities for up-and-coming talent to share their love for music and the energy, community and passion that comes with it.
